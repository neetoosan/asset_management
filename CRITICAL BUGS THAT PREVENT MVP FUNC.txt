 CRITICAL BUGS THAT PREVENT MVP FUNCTIONALITY

1. Database Model Issues:
◦  UserSession model has duplicate column definitions (lines 372-373 and 379-385 in models.py)
◦  Inconsistent data types for session status (is_active defined twice with different defaults)
◦  Missing relationships and foreign key constraints issues
2. Missing Static Assets:
◦  No app/static/images/ directory exists
◦  Logo files referenced in code (logo.png, logo.jpg) are missing
◦  No icon resources for the UI (references to :/icons/dashboard, :/icons/plus)
3. Database Initialization Issues:
◦  Database granted field inconsistency (granted=True vs granted="true")
◦  Hard-coded database URL in config (should use environment variables)


 MODERATE ISSUES

4. Authentication & Security:
◦  Default admin credentials are hard-coded
◦  No proper session management for the desktop app
◦  Password hashing inconsistency between UserService and AuthService
5. GUI Implementation Gaps:
◦  Asset dialog functionality incomplete
◦  No actual chart implementations (placeholder text only)
◦  Missing API endpoint implementations
6. Configuration Management:
◦  No .env file or environment variable setup
◦  Missing pyproject.toml, README.md, .gitignore
◦  No proper logging configuration
