📊 ESTIMATED EFFORT TO MVP

•  Phase 1 (Critical): 2-3 days
•  Phase 2 (Features): 5-7 days
•  Phase 3 (Polish): 3-5 days

Total MVP Timeline: 10-15 development days

🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. Fix the UserSession model duplicate column issue
2. Create the missing static asset directories and files
3. Standardize the database initialization script
4. Create proper environment configuration
5. Test the login functionality end-to-end

The project has a solid foundation with good architecture, but needs these critical fixes to become a functional MVP. The codebase quality is high, and the service layer is well-designed, which will make the fixes relatively straightforward to implement.
